        <br>
        <br>
        <p1 class="paragraph1">
            We already know that social media is very used by all kind of people, but it is the most popular among the youth, especially students. We spend so much time on internet and sometimes we don’t even realize this.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            But would it change something if we would know the effects that social media has on us? In this article we will see what the benefits of social media are but also the bad effects of using it.

        <div class="learning_text">
            <p1>Social Media helps students a lot because it increases the collaboration between them. Team projects are easier to review, and we can share to each other useful sources for learning (e.g. books, websites, links etc.), so we can be more productive in less time than if we had met face to face.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                Facebook groups are the most useful for that because they are well-structured and it is very easy to make announcements, chat, share the ideas etc. If you and your classmates have never tried that, maybe this is the right time to start!

        <div class="touch_text">
            <p1>As a foreign student is very important to talk with your friends and your relatives from home, so social media is a cheap way to keep in touch with them because the only thing you need is internet, and seriously, internet is everywhere!
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                Moreover, you also have to be able to communicate with your fellow students so you can ask any question anytime and also is a good way to make new friends by chatting or getting closer to the ones you already have.

        <div class="inspiration_text">
            <p1>Student…such a nice word. Of course, a student has a lot of work to do, as you already know. Making projects, coming up with ideas, being creative…wait a sec…but how can you be creative if you don’t have a source of inspiration? Social media is the best thing for that, trust me!
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>


                There are a lot of people who are posting creative stuff, especially on Instagram and Pinterest and you can be inspired by them. So go and find people that make you feel something good and inspires you and follow them. Maybe someday their ideas will help you with yours, even it is about a new project at school or a new crazy make-up look.

            <p1>Social media is one of the best ways to find events and sign up for them. There are a lot of events on Facebook that could be interesting for you, such as parties, concerts or expositions.

                <br>

    <br>
    <div class="addiction_text">
    In a life surrounded by technology it is normally for the most of us to spend a lot of time on social media. But sometimes we cross the line and we forget there are other things we should do, for example hanging out with our friends or dedicate more time to our hobbies.
 <br>
        <br>
        <br>

The abuse of social media also has bad effects on our body and our habits: we don’t get the amount of hours of sleep that we need so we won’t be able to work efficiently because our brain and our memory are collateral victims of our vices.

<h2 class="hurtful">Gives people the opportunity to be hurtful</h2>

        <p6 class="credit">Eduard Stoica (credit: Raluca Calin)</p6>
        <div class="hurtful_text">
        You have surely seen at least once a hurtful comment or an inappropriate post about a sensitive topic for somebody. Yes , I am talking about haters, those people who reacts negatively on someone’ s post. Of course everyone has the right ti have an opinion, but being mean is not a solution .
<br>
            <br>
            <br>

Haters lower the self-confidence of other’s work and make them feel that they are not good enough. So how do we stop them? We can’t . but what we can do is to realize that there are always going to be people who criticize us, but we have to go on and take the constructive feedback from other users.

        <h2 class="stereotype"> It creates a stereotype of “How should we be”</h2>

         <p6 class="credit">"Do not stereotype me" (by Raluca Calin)</p6>
        <div class="stereotype_text">
        <p1>We know that the world implemented a stereotype of how should be “the perfect look”, “the perfect body”, “the perfect picture” and so on, and this has bad effects on our self-confidence and it makes us to limit ourselves in a negatively way.

<br>
            <br>
            <br>
Don’t be afraid to be original! As I said, there will always be people who appreciate you and people who criticize you, but what matters the most is you to be satisfied with yourself and with the choices you made. So be who you want, do what you want (but of course, don’t break the law).
