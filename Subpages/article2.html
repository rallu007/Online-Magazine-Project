     <p class="follow_text">We spend a lot of time on internet to check what others are doing. For optimizing our time spent on social media we should follow only people that we appreciate and that we have something to learn from.
<br>
         <br>
         <br>

When we see a post on Instagram or Facebook we should feel inspired, but we have to follow the right people for that. A wise decision would be to follow only your closed friends and some influencers, photographers or celebrities that makes you enjoy their activity on social media.

     <br>
     <br>
 <p class="proud_text">Done something great? Let people know about it! Share your work with other people so you can get feedback on it, or just for inspire them. We live in a world where social media represent a huge part of our lives, and posting your photos or videos could be a great thing for you and for others as well.
<br>
     <br>
     <br>

Also posting your stuff means to keep all your memories and important moments from your life in a safe place. Even if you lose your phone or you forget the password from your google account, your memories will still be there.

     <br>
     <p class="ideas_text">Have fun, but be selective. Never forget that. Not everything on social media is a good thing. Not every idea is a good one.  Make sure what you are posting or who you are following represents you as a person.
<br>
         <br>
         <br>

Go crazy and if you are interested in something or you are good at something let people know about it. Your followers are there for a reason, but never be afraid of going out from your comfort zone, because thatâ€™s how great ideas are born.
